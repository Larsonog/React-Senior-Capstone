          Welcome to Encylopedia Conway a webpage for anything and everything going on in Conway, Arkansas.
          This project is for my Senior Seminar class at Hendrix College. I am currently a senior there
          graduating in May 2024. This website has always been a passion project for me. As a lifetime Conway
          resident myself, I have always wanted to know what's going on and finding that information has always
          been difficult. This project is both for new and long time residents for Conway.
          Enjoy!
